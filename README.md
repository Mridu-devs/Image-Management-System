Introduction

The Image Management System is a web application built using React.js on the front-end and
Node.js, MySQL, and Multer on the back-end.
It allows users to upload images along with associated metadata such as name, keyword, and additional input fields for future reference.
The system provides a search functionality to find images based on keyword or name.
